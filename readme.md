## Storyline
The Siuslaw river is a short river that runs from the Oregon coast range out to the Pacific Ocean.
It cuts through the Tyee sandstone formation and passes thorugh a few small towns.

The hills surrounding the river have been logged repeatedly in the last several decades. The hillsides are
checkered in monocrops, and there are several landslides which have occurred as a result of logging activities.

Running parallel to the river are a railroad that connects Coos Bay to Eugene, and an old stagecoach road
that was once the only road between Eugene and Florence, but has now been replaced in function by Highway 126.

The Siuslaw is an undammed river that provides summertime recreation and wintertime fishing. It is a popular
destination for local residents year round.
